Burger Destroyer is a burger logger that allows users to input the names of burgers that they would like to eat! Once they have devoured that burger, they can mark it off their list! The log is persistent, which makes the information available to them whenever they need it.

## Usage

The site is fairly straightforward. Users are allowed to input the name of a burger that they would like to consume, which gets logged in the left column under `CONSUME`. From there, they have a choice to `DEVOUR` the burger, which will move it over to the right column titled `DEVOURED`. At any point, they can decide to `BANISH` a burger, which will remove it from the list entirely.
